# Analyzing Selling Price of Used Cars



## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of selling prices for used cars. Leveraging various features such as mileage, model year, brand, and additional factors, we aim to provide insights into the determinants of a car's resale value. The analysis employs data visualization and machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and factors influencing the selling prices of used cars.

## Key Features

**Comprehensive Dataset:** The dataset used in this project encompasses diverse information about used cars, including mileage, model year, brand, fuel type, and other relevant features.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilizing data visualization techniques to gain insights into the distribution and relationships among variables.

**Machine Learning Modeling:** Employing regression models to predict and analyze the selling prices of used cars based on various features.

**Data-driven Insights:** Providing actionable insights for both sellers and buyers in the used car market.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following key directories:

 **data:** Contains the dataset used for analysis.

 **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks detailing the data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and analysis.

 **src:** Source code for the machine learning models, including scripts for data preprocessing and analysis.

 **docs:** Project documentation, including this README file.
